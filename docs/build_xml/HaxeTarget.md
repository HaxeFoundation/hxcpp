The Haxe Target
---------------

When compiling from haxe, via hxcpp, a "Build.xml" file is generated in the output directory.  The file lists the generated files and dependencies and ultimately includes the "toolchain/haxe-target.xml" file, which describes how to combine these files.

### Include Order
There are a few complications when setting the order in which things are configured, since a particular build might want to:
  - set the compiler
  - override some compiler settings
  - make decisions based on the compiler or settings
  - set or use standard file prefixes/suffixes 

### Example Sequence
You can see which files are included by setting the HXCPP_VERBOSE define when compiling.  One example is for a hypothetical user 'Hugh' on a windows platform:

```
Using makefile: Build.xml
No specified toolchain
 - Parsing include: C:/Users/Hugh/dev/hxcpp/toolchain/setup.xml
 - Parsing include: C:\Users\Hugh\.hxcpp_config.xml (section "vars")
Using Windows compiler: MSVC
 - Parsing include: C:/Users/Hugh/dev/hxcpp/toolchain/finish-setup.xml
 - Parsing makefile: C:\Users\Hugh\test\proj\cpp\Build.xml
 - Parsing include: C:/Users/Hugh/dev/hxcpp/build-tool/BuildCommon.xml
 - Parsing include: C:/Users/Hugh/dev/hxcpp/toolchain/haxe-target.xml
 - Parsing include: C:/Users/Hugh/dev/hxcpp/toolchain/msvc-toolchain.xml
 - Parsing compiler: C:/Users/Hugh/dev/hxcpp/toolchain/common-defines.xml
 - Parsing include: C:\Users\Hugh\.hxcpp_config.xml (section "exes")
```

- setup.xml is read because no custom toolchain is specified, and this just include hxcpp_config
- the 'vars' section of hxcpp_config is read - mainly to setup SDK locations
- the hxcpp build tool then uses internal logic based on host and defines to work out which compiler/toolchain to use
- finish-setup then sets a bunch of standard defines for file-extensions and linking flags based on
   the type of toolchain being used.
- The provided buildfile (Build.xml) is then processed. It can use the standard defines from finish-setup.
- Build.xml imports the standard haxe-target buildfile, which adds standard runtime files
- The toolchain file is then parsed - making use of any settings from the main Build.xml and finish-setup.
  - This file includes the "common-defines.xml" from the compiler to inject standard haxe compiler flags
- hxcpp_config "exe" is parsed.  Historically to add libraries or build-paths to targets.


### Standard Environment
finish-setup.xml is where the conventions are set. These variables include:
  - haxelink = dll|static_link|exe
  - LIBPREFIX = lib|""
  - LIBEXTRA =
     +  .iphonesim-64
     +  .iphonesim
     +  .iphoneos
     +  .iphoneos-v7
     +  .iphoneos-v7s
     +  .iphoneos-64
     +  .appletvsim-64
     +  .appletvsim
     +  .watchos
     +  .watchsimulator
     +  -x86
     +  -v7
     +  -64
  - HX_LINK_SUFFIX = LIBEXTRA | -19 (msvc 19)
  - LIBEXT = .a|.lib
  - DBG = ""|"-debug"
  - OBJEXT = "-list-of-config-ids" depending on available options

These variables are used by haxe-target - you can use them too.  Haxe then builds the "haxe" target, which uses some code like:
```xml
  <set name="HAXE_OUTPUT_FILE" value="${LIBPREFIX}${HAXE_OUTPUT_PART}${DBG}" />

  <target id="haxe" tool="linker" toolid="${haxelink}" output="${HAXE_OUTPUT_FILE}">
    <ext value="${LIBEXTRA}.a" if="static_link" /> 
    <!-- ... -->
    <files id="__main__" unless="static_link" />
    <files id="__lib__" if="static_link"/>
    <files id="__resources__" />
    <files id="__externs__" />
    <files id="runtime" unless="dll_import" />
    <files id="cppia" if="scriptable" />
    <lib name="-lpthread" if="linux" unless="static_link" />
    <lib name="-ldl" if="linux" unless="static_link" />
  </target>
```

Here you can see the various file groups, which are enabled or not depending on the compiler mode, and some standard libraries that are needed for Linux.

### Experimenting With Hxcpp Generated Code/Build.xml
If you are using external cpp code, or using meta-data to inject xml into the build process, and you are getting a compile or link error, then it can be useful to run the hxcpp build tool without re-running haxe.  This lets you hand-edit the build file or generated c++ code until you get things to work.  Once you have solved the issues using this technique, then you can move the changes back into the injected/external code.

First, compile haxe with '-v' flag.  This gives quite a bit of debug, but will include a like like this:
```
haxelib run hxcpp Build.xml haxe -Dhaxe3="1" -Dhaxe_ver="4.000" -Dhxcpp_api_level="332" -Dsource-header="Generated by Haxe 4.0.0" -I"" -I"C:/Users/Hugh/dev/haxe/std/cpp/_std/" -I"C:/Users/Hugh/dev/haxe/std/"
```

To use this, first change directories to your output directory.  This will be the one you specified with the "-cpp" haxe compiler option.  Then, cut and paste this command into a shell, cmd or batch file.
