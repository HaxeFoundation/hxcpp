Defines
-------

There are a number of standard defines you can use to control the hxcpp build.  Some of these are used by the haxe compiler, and affect then generated code.  Others apply to the build tool and affect how the code is compiled.

Defines affecting how the code is generated.  These need to be in the command line when calling haxe.

| Define                  | Meaning            |
|-------------------------|--------------------|
| *HXCPP_DEBUGGER*        | Add extra macros required by debugger.  Usually added automatically be debugger haxelib |
| *HXCPP_GC_GENERATIONAL* | Enable experimental generational garbage collector |
| *annotate_source*       | Add additional annotations to source code - useful for developing hxcpp |
| *dll_export*            | Export hxcpp runtime symbols |
| *file_extension*        | Set the extension (without the dot) of generated files.  eg "-D file_extension=mm" for objc++ code  |
| *force_native_property* | Make dynamic access of fields call property getters/setters where appropriate |
| *include_prefix*        | Place all generated include files in a sub-directory, eg "-D include_prefix=hxinc".  Useful for avoiding name clashes |
| *no-compilation*        | Generate the code, but do not compile it |
| *no-debug*              | Do not generate debug macros in code |
| *nocppiaast*            | Use legacy cppia generation instead of new more recent changes |
| *objc*                  | Generate objective-c++ classes |
| *scriptable*            | Enable extra runtime information required for scripting |



Defines affecting how the code is compiled.  These can be on the command line when calling haxe, or added via the hxcpp build environment.
